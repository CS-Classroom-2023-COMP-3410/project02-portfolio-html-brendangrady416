Project 2 - Portfolio

This project was very straight forward and was completed fairly smoothly. I was able to use Chat gpt to build a skeleton for my index page which I had it use as a blueprint for each of my other pages. I then went into each file and added my information and tried to give the page a little style which was hard while using only basic html. The only issue with Chat gpt was that it kept trying to input css into my files which I had to correct. Other than that most of my trouble came from trying to get proper spacing and aligning the elements on the page where they needed to be which was fixed over time as I was refamiliarized with html.
